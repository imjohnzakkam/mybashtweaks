bash tweaking is an art they say, yes it is.

We all know that Linux is open-source right, one day I was exploring random directories, suddenly I opened some file which was all like `They are speaking the language of the gods` meme, it was `~/.bashrc`.  
So, I thought can I edit it ? , and here I am.  


Since we all work everyday in Linux, some aliases/snippets could be useful.  

An `alias` means as the name suggests, we call something instead of something else.  
A `snippet` is a piece of code which behaves in the same way we define it.  

Some of my  `aliases and snippets `  :
